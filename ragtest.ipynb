It is important to capture this\\nelement for the students. The history of\\nmoney and how various forms were used at\\ndifferent times is an interesting story. At this\\nstage the purpose is to allow students to\\nrealise the social situation in which these\\nforms were used. Modern forms of money are\\nlinked to the banking system. This is the\\ncentral idea of the first part of the chapter.\\nThe present situation in India, where\\nnewer forms of money are slowly spreading\\nwith computerisation of the banking system,\\noffers many opportunities to students to\\nexplore on their own. We need not get into a\\nformal discussion of the ‘functions of money’\\nbut let it come up as questions. There are\\ncertain areas that are not covered, such as\\n‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the\\nbacking of the modern system that may be\\ndiscussed if you desire.\\nAs you would see in the chapter, the stock\\nof money consists of currency held by the\\npublic and the demand deposits that they hold\\nwith the banks. This is the money that people\\ncan use as they wish and the government has\\nto ensure that the system works smoothy.\\nWhat would happen when the government\\ndeclares that some of the currency notes used\\nby people would be made invalid and would be\\nreplaced by new currency? In India, during\\nNovember 2016, currency notes in the\\ndenomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were\\ndeclared invalid. People were asked to\\nsurrender these notes to the bank by a specific\\nperiod and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or\\nother currency notes. This is known as\\n‘demonetisation’. Since then, people were also\\nencouraged to use their bank deposits rather\\nthan cash for transactions. Hence, digital\\ntransactions started by using bank-to-bank\\ntransfer through the internet or mobile\\nphones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards,\\nand Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at\\nshops. This is promoted to reduce the\\nrequirement of cash for transactions and also\\ncontrol corruption. Students could be asked\\nto debate on the process and the impact of\\ndemonetisation. They can be guided to make\\na collage of the major areas where people use\\ndigital and cash transactions which are\\nlegitimate and legal. They can also discuss the\\ntransactions which are legal and why. It is also\\nimportant to intimate students that different\\ntypes of plastic cards are used in place of cash\\ntransactions but not all of them money per se.\\nCredit is a crucial element in economic\\nlife and it is, therefore, important to first\\nunderstand this in a conceptual manner.\\nWhat are the aspects that one looks at in\\nany credit arrangement and how this affects\\npeople is the main focus of the second part\\nof the chapter. The world around us offers a\\ntremendous variety of such arrangements\\nand it would be ideal to explain these\\naspects of credit from situations that are\\nfamiliar to your students. The other crucial\\nissue of credit is its availability to all,\\nespecially the poor, and on reasonable\\nterms. We need to emphasise that this is a\\nright of the people and without which a large\\nsection of them would be kept out of the\\ndevelopment process. There are many\\ninnovative interventions, such as that of\\nGrameen Bank, of which students may be\\nmade familiar with but it is important to\\nrealise that we don’t have answers to all\\nquestions. We need to find new ways and\\nthis is one of the social challenges that\\ndeveloping countries face.\\nSources for Information\\nThe data on formal and informal sector credit\\nused in this chapter is drawn from the\\nsurvey on rural debt by the National Sample\\nSurvey Organisation (All India Debt and\\nInvestment Survey, 70 th  Round 2013,\\nconducted by NSSO) now known as National\\nStatistical Office (NSO).

Look around\\nyou and you would easily be able to\\nidentify several transactions involving\\nmoney in any single day. Can you\\nmake a list of these? In many of these\\ntransactions, goods are being bought\\nand sold with the use of money. In\\nsome of these transactions, services\\nare being exchanged with money.  For\\nsome, there might not be any actual\\ntransfer of money taking place now\\nbut a promise to pay money later.\\nHave you ever wondered why\\ntransactions are made in\\nmoney? The reason is simple.\\nA person holding money can easily\\nexchange it for any commodity or\\nservice that he or she might want.\\nThus everyone  prefers to receive\\npayments in money and then\\nexchange the money for things that\\nthey want.  Take the case of a shoe\\nmanufacturer. He wants to sell shoes\\nin the market and buy wheat.  The\\nshoe manufacturer will first exchange\\nshoes that he has produced for\\nmoney, and then exchange the money\\nfor wheat. Imagine how much more\\ndifficult it would be if the shoe\\nmanufacturer had to directly\\nexchange shoes for wheat without the\\nuse of money. He would have to look\\nfor a wheat growing farmer who not\\nonly wants to sell wheat\\nbut also wants to buy the\\nshoes in exchange.\\nThat is, both parties\\nhave to agree to\\nsell and buy each\\nothers commodities.\\nThis is known as\\ndouble coincidence\\nof wants.  What a person\\ndesires to sell is exactly what the\\nother wishes to buy. In a barter\\nsystem where goods are directly\\nexchanged without the use of money,\\ndouble coincidence of wants is an\\nessential feature.\\nIn contrast, in an economy where\\nmoney is in use, money by providing\\nthe crucial intermediate step\\neliminates the need for double\\ncoincidence of wants. It is no longer\\nnecessary for the shoe manufacturer\\nto look for a farmer who will buy his\\nshoes and at the same time sell him\\nMONEY MONEYMONEYMONEYMONEY\\nANDANDAND\\nANDAND\\nCREDIT CREDIT\\nCREDIT CREDITCREDIT\\nCHAPTER 3\\nMONEY AS A MEDIUM OF EX CHANGE\\nI’LL GIVE\\nYOU SHOES\\nFOR YOUR\\nWHEAT.\\nI DON’T NEED\\nSHOES.

Before\\nthe introduction of coins, a variety of\\nobjects was used as money. For\\nexample, since the very early ages,\\nIndians used  grains and cattle as\\nmoney. Thereafter came the use of\\nmetallic coins — gold, silver, copper\\ncoins — a phase which continued well\\ninto the last century.\\nCurrency\\nModern forms of money include\\ncurrency — paper notes and coins.\\nUnlike the things that were used as\\nmoney earlier, modern currency is not\\nmade of precious metal such as gold,\\nsilver and copper.  And unlike grain\\nand cattle, they are neither of\\neveryday use. The modern currency\\nis without any use of its own.\\nThen, why is it accepted as a\\nmedium of exchange?  It is accepted\\nas a medium of exchange because the\\ncurrency is authorised by the\\ngovernment of the country.\\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India\\nissues currency notes on behalf of the\\ncentral government. As per Indian\\nlaw, no other individual or\\norganisation is allowed to issue\\ncurrency. Moreover, the law legalises\\nthe use of rupee as a medium of\\npayment that cannot be refused in\\nsettling transactions in India. No\\nindividual in India can legally refuse\\na payment made in rupees. Hence,\\nthe rupee is widely accepted as a\\nmedium of exchange.\\nDeposits with Banks\\nThe other form in which people hold\\nmoney is as deposits with banks. At\\na point of time, people need only some\\ncurrency  for their day-to-day needs.\\nFor instance, workers who receive\\ntheir salaries at the end of each month\\nhave extra cash at the beginning of\\nthe month. What do people do with\\nthis extra cash? They deposit it with\\nthe banks by opening a bank\\naccount in their name. Banks accept\\nthe deposits and also pay an amount\\nas interest on the deposits. In this way\\npeople’s money is safe with the\\nbanks and it earns an amount as\\ninterest.  People also have the\\nprovision to withdraw the money as\\nand when they require. Since the\\ndeposits in the bank accounts can be\\nwithdrawn on demand, these\\ndeposits are called demand deposits.\\n1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?\\n2.

However , the\\nmoneylenders charge very high rates\\nof interest, keep no records of the\\ntransactions and harass the poor\\nborrowers.\\nIn recent years, people have tried\\nout some newer ways of providing\\nloans to the poor .

A typical SHG has 15-20\\nmembers, usually belonging to one\\nneighbourhood, who meet and save\\nregularly. Saving per member varies\\nfrom Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more,\\ndepending on the ability of the people\\nto save. Members can take small loans\\nfrom the group itself to meet their\\nneeds. The group charges interest on\\nthese loans but this is still less than\\nwhat the moneylender charges. After\\na year or two, if the group is regular\\nin savings, it becomes eligible for\\navailing loan from the bank.\\nLoan is sanctioned in the\\nname of the group and is\\nmeant to create self-\\nemployment opportunities\\nfor the members. For\\ninstance, small loans are\\nprovided to the members for\\nreleasing mortgaged land,\\nfor meeting working capital\\nneeds (e.g. buying seeds,\\nfertilisers, raw materials\\nlike bamboo and cloth), for\\nhousing materials, for\\nacquiring assets like sewing\\nmachine, handlooms, cattle,\\netc.\\nMost of the important\\ndecisions regarding the\\nsavings and loan activities\\nare taken by the group\\nmembers. The group\\ndecides as regards the loans\\nto be granted — the purpose, amount,\\ninterest to be charged, repayment\\nschedule etc.  Also, it is the group\\nwhich is responsible for the repayment\\nof the loan. Any case of non-\\nrepayment of loan by any one\\nmember is followed up seriously by\\nother members in the group. Because\\nof this feature, banks are willing to\\nlend to the poor women when\\norganised in SHGs, even though they\\nhave no collateral as such.\\nThus, the SHGs help borrowers\\novercome the problem of lack of\\ncollateral.

Look around\\nyou and you would easily be able to\\nidentify several transactions involving\\nmoney in any single day. Can you\\nmake a list of these? In many of these\\ntransactions, goods are being bought\\nand sold with the use of money. In\\nsome of these transactions, services\\nare being exchanged with money.  For\\nsome, there might not be any actual\\ntransfer of money taking place now\\nbut a promise to pay money later.\\nHave you ever wondered why\\ntransactions are made in\\nmoney? The reason is simple.\\nA person holding money can easily\\nexchange it for any commodity or\\nservice that he or she might want.\\nThus everyone  prefers to receive\\npayments in money and then\\nexchange the money for things that\\nthey want.  Take the case of a shoe\\nmanufacturer. He wants to sell shoes\\nin the market and buy wheat.  The\\nshoe manufacturer will first exchange\\nshoes that he has produced for\\nmoney, and then exchange the money\\nfor wheat. Imagine how much more\\ndifficult it would be if the shoe\\nmanufacturer had to directly\\nexchange shoes for wheat without the\\nuse of money. He would have to look\\nfor a wheat growing farmer who not\\nonly wants to sell wheat\\nbut also wants to buy the\\nshoes in exchange.\\nThat is, both parties\\nhave to agree to\\nsell and buy each\\nothers commodities.\\nThis is known as\\ndouble coincidence\\nof wants.  What a person\\ndesires to sell is exactly what the\\nother wishes to buy. In a barter\\nsystem where goods are directly\\nexchanged without the use of money,\\ndouble coincidence of wants is an\\nessential feature.\\nIn contrast, in an economy where\\nmoney is in use, money by providing\\nthe crucial intermediate step\\neliminates the need for double\\ncoincidence of wants. It is no longer\\nnecessary for the shoe manufacturer\\nto look for a farmer who will buy his\\nshoes and at the same time sell him\\nMONEY MONEYMONEYMONEYMONEY\\nANDANDAND\\nANDAND\\nCREDIT CREDIT\\nCREDIT CREDITCREDIT\\nCHAPTER 3\\nMONEY AS A MEDIUM OF EX CHANGE\\nI’LL GIVE\\nYOU SHOES\\nFOR YOUR\\nWHEAT.\\nI DON’T NEED\\nSHOES.

Before\\nthe introduction of coins, a variety of\\nobjects was used as money. For\\nexample, since the very early ages,\\nIndians used  grains and cattle as\\nmoney. Thereafter came the use of\\nmetallic coins — gold, silver, copper\\ncoins — a phase which continued well\\ninto the last century.\\nCurrency\\nModern forms of money include\\ncurrency — paper notes and coins.\\nUnlike the things that were used as\\nmoney earlier, modern currency is not\\nmade of precious metal such as gold,\\nsilver and copper.  And unlike grain\\nand cattle, they are neither of\\neveryday use. The modern currency\\nis without any use of its own.\\nThen, why is it accepted as a\\nmedium of exchange?  It is accepted\\nas a medium of exchange because the\\ncurrency is authorised by the\\ngovernment of the country.\\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India\\nissues currency notes on behalf of the\\ncentral government. As per Indian\\nlaw, no other individual or\\norganisation is allowed to issue\\ncurrency. Moreover, the law legalises\\nthe use of rupee as a medium of\\npayment that cannot be refused in\\nsettling transactions in India. No\\nindividual in India can legally refuse\\na payment made in rupees. Hence,\\nthe rupee is widely accepted as a\\nmedium of exchange.\\nDeposits with Banks\\nThe other form in which people hold\\nmoney is as deposits with banks. At\\na point of time, people need only some\\ncurrency  for their day-to-day needs.\\nFor instance, workers who receive\\ntheir salaries at the end of each month\\nhave extra cash at the beginning of\\nthe month. What do people do with\\nthis extra cash? They deposit it with\\nthe banks by opening a bank\\naccount in their name. Banks accept\\nthe deposits and also pay an amount\\nas interest on the deposits. In this way\\npeople’s money is safe with the\\nbanks and it earns an amount as\\ninterest.  People also have the\\nprovision to withdraw the money as\\nand when they require. Since the\\ndeposits in the bank accounts can be\\nwithdrawn on demand, these\\ndeposits are called demand deposits.\\n1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?\\n2. Can you think of some examples of goods / services being exchanged or wages being\\npaid through barter?\\nLET’S WORK THESE OUT\\nMODERN FORMS OF  MONEY\\nEarly punch-\\nmarked coins\\n(may be 2500\\nyears old)\\nGupta\\ncoins\\nGold\\nMohar\\nfrom\\nAkbar’s\\nreign\\nwheat.
